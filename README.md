# Methods_for_Data_Science_Courseworks

Imperial College MATH60026 Methods for Data Science is a coursework-only module consisting of two courseworks.

The first coursework covers implementing a decision tree and random forest, and a MLP (all using only numpy) on the nanonelectrodes dataset. The second task is to implement kNN and logistic regression on the brain cancer dataset, which is imbalanced (class 2 is a underrepresented class), where we explored methods like weighted kNN and 2-step kNN and kernelised logistic regression.

I got 87/100 for this coursework.

The second coursework deals with the star images dataset, which has both images as (32,32) array, and an embedding (180,) array from the output of a CNN to train against their star labels. The first task involves implementing a CNN (pytorch is allowed). The second task involves exploring unsupervised methods like PCA, building a kNN graph using cosine distance and explore its normalised laplacian, and using an ISOMAP-like algorithm to explore the resistance distance and centered distance matrix.
